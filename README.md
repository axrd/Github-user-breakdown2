# Github-user-breakdown2

## Overview

GitHub is home to over 28 million developers working together to host and review code, manage projects, and build software together.
this is where GitHub gets interesting for recruiters! Each and every developer using GitHub, a profile that is visible to the public. And on it you can find all sorts of fantastic information about that person such as :-

    Username
 
    Number of Repositories
  
    Languages working on
  
    Contribution to projects

People visiting the site will be able to understand  the candidates proficiency of work and sutability for specific task by viewing actual github activity.

We are building here an app which accepts a github username and returns a breakdown of that user's activity using the data provided by GitHub for that username.

## MVP
App should display username, commit history, most common day of week and hour of day of commits. App analyzes languages used in repositories and gives breakdown of what languages a user typically works with. 

## Stretch 
App displays most popular user-owned repositories. App displays most popular repositories that the user has contributed to but not authored. 

## Dataset
Github API - https://developer.github.com/v3/

## Deployment
Recommend to deploy your server to [Heroku](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-nodejs), and your front end to [netlify](https://www.netlify.com/blog/2016/09/29/a-step-by-step-guide-deploying-on-netlify/). Both services provide free tiers and easy to use interfaces. 
It is recommended that you keep your front end and backend codebases in separate GitHub repositories.
