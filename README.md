Github user breakdown 2

# Overview
# GitHub
GitHub is home to over 28 million developers working together to host and review code, manage projects, and build software together.
this is where GitHub gets interesting for recruiters! Each and every developer using GitHub, has to set up an account â€“ a profile that is visible to the public. And on it you can find all sorts of fantastic information about that person such as :-
    Username
    Number of Repositories
    Languages working on
    Contribution to projects

People visiting the site will be able to know the candidates work in better way.
  
We are building here an app which accepts a github username hits the API and returns a breakdown of that user's activity.

# MVP

# Stretch 
App displays most popular user-owned repositories. App displays most popular repositories that the user has contributed to but not authored. 

# Dataset
